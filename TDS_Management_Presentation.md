## Solution Logic - Live Examples

### Scenario 1: Customer Approaching Threshold
```
Initial State:
- Cashback Received (FY): ₹19,000
- Unredeemed Points: ₹500
- Customer earns: ₹1,800

Calculation:
- Total exposure: ₹19,000 + ₹500 + ₹1,800 = ₹21,300
- Exceeds ₹20,000 by: ₹1,300
- TDS @ 10%: ₹2,130
- TDS to deduct now: ₹1,630
- Redeemable points: ₹170
```

### Scenario 2: Subsequent Transaction
```
After first TDS deduction:
- Cashback Received: ₹19,000
- TDS Already Held: ₹2,130
- New earnings: ₹1,800

Calculation:
- Total TDS liability: ₹2,310
- Already deducted: ₹2,130
- Additional TDS needed: ₹180
- Redeemable from ₹1,800: ₹1,620
```
